# Weather app project in the advanced javascript course

I am practicing the API calls and making a weather app with the 
weather Visual Crossing API from the previous lesson. Also, might 
include the Giphy API to mess with two API's at once. Also recently 
learned about promises, asynchronous code (code that does something in 
the background that takes time without stopping the rest of the javascript
execution), and async/await. Need to apply those concepts to contact the
Visual Crossing API and make a weather forcasting site that gets data 
from the API and displays it to the user when the user provides a location. 

# Functionality requirements: 
    1. Should be able to search for specific location's weather in Fahrenheit or Celcius
    
    2. Page should change look based on data (like changing the color of the background to match the weather), or using 
    images or gifs (from Giphy) or something to represent the returned weather. 

    3. Should use asynchronous code (either promises or async/await) to wait and process data from the 
    API's. 

    note: Since the current API's that we are using (giphy and visual crossing) are PUBLIC API's 
    and the API key we are going to be using is the public free keys, not the paid ones, we are going to 
    expose the keys for now on github. We will learn on how to store API keys on the server with global 
    variables (backend stuff).
